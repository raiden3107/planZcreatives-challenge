# planZcreatives-challenge

Dear concerned individuals,

I have completed the challenge that was given to me. Also i have used expressJS and mongoDB Atlas for cloud database so that the database
will no longer have to run on Localhost. I have also integerated chartJS for the demo of how it can be used for the data.

When you download the project folder, run the command "npm run dev" to start the program and you can fire the API's from the postman
by finding the desired API in my code.

Hope it is satisfactory.

Thank you.
